### 1. [**Schematics**](pplx://action/followup)
- **[CMOS Inverter Symbol](pplx://action/followup)**  
  File: `symbol.jpg`  
  This file shows the symbolic representation of the CMOS inverter with input (`Vin`), output (`Vout`), power supply (`Vdd`), and ground (`gnd`) connections.

- **[Testbench](pplx://action/followup)**  
  File: `tb.jpg`  
  The testbench schematic used for simulating the CMOS inverter. It includes the input voltage source and connections to measure the output.

### 2. [**Plots/Results**](pplx://action/followup)
- **[PMOS and NMOS Regions](pplx://action/followup)**  
  File: `PMOS_NMOS_regions.jpg`  
  This plot highlights the operational regions of PMOS and NMOS transistors (cutoff, linear, saturation, and sub-threshold) in the CMOS inverter based on input voltage levels.

- **[Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)](pplx://action/followup)**  
  File: `vtc_points.jpg`  
  The VTC curve of the CMOS inverter showing key points such as switching threshold and slope values. It provides insight into the inverter's behavior across different input voltages.
