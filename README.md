### 1. [**Schematics**](pplx://action/followup)
- **[CMOS Inverter Symbol](pplx://action/followup)**

  This file shows the symbolic representation of the CMOS inverter with input (`Vin`), output (`Vout`), power supply (`Vdd`), and ground (`gnd`) connections.

  

- **[Testbench](pplx://action/followup)**
  
  <img src="https://github.com/RohanRudra/CMOS_Inverter/blob/main/Plots/tb.png" />  
  The testbench schematic used for simulating the CMOS inverter. It includes the input voltage source and connections to measure the output.
  

### 2. [**Plots/Results**](pplx://action/followup)
- **[PMOS and NMOS Regions](pplx://action/followup)**
  
  <img src="https://github.com/RohanRudra/CMOS_Inverter/blob/main/Plots/PMOS_NMOS_regions.jpg" /> 
  This plot highlights the operational regions of PMOS and NMOS transistors (cutoff, linear, saturation, and sub-threshold) in the CMOS inverter based on input voltage levels.

  

- **[Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)](pplx://action/followup)**
  
  <img src="https://github.com/RohanRudra/CMOS_Inverter/blob/main/Plots/vtc_points.jpg" /> 
  The VTC curve of the CMOS inverter showing key points such as switching threshold and slope values. It provides insight into the inverter's behavior across different input voltages.
